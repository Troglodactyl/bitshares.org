     <h1>Vision</h1>
     <p>
     The long term benefit of decentralized autonomous companies is the creation of millions of information-based jobs that allow everyone to make money by contributing what they know to the market.  Whether you love music, inventions, news articles, insurance, or currency speculation, there will be ample opportunity for you to make money on what you know.
     </p>
     <p>
     Consensus technology has the power to do for economics what the internet did for information.
     </p>

     <p>
     Consensus technology can harness the combined power of all humanity to coordinate the discovery and aggregation of real-time knowledge previously unobtainable.   This knowledge can be used to more effectively coordinate the allocation of resources toward their most productive and valuable use.
