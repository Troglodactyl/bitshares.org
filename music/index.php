      <h3>Music</h3>
      <p>
      The music industry has been fighting copyright violations since the birth of the Internet, but
      with the latest technologies that enable transparent decentralized ledgers it is now possible 
      for artists to sell shares in their songs rather than copies of their songs.  
      </p>
      <p>
      The advantage of selling shares in your songs is that share value is attached to song
      popularity.  Fans have incentive to buy shares and then share the song to increase its
      popularity.  This turns the incentive structure on its head and allows new bands to use crowd funding
      to get the money they need to make it big.
      </p>
      <p>
      There is already one team working on making this a reality.  More information will be available soon.
