      <h2>Decentralized Lending</h2>
      <p>
      Lending is one of the more difficult systems to decentralize because it generally
      involves matters of trust and credit worthiness.  These things typically require individual
      judgment and ultimately accountability.
      </p>
      <p> 
      Ripple is the first system that has entered the scene that allows individuals to extend 
      credit to one other on a decentralized ledger system.  This ledger system facilitates 
      the settlement of debt among many parties, some of whom may not know each other directly.

         <h2>Ripple</h2>
         <p>
         The Ripple network allows individuals to extend credit directly to one another and will
         automatically ripple payments between strangers through a network of credit relationships.

         <p>
         Bitshares ME allows individuals to issue their own individual shares.  These shares can be used to
         represent their own IOUs that can then circulate.  This can be seen as a form of peer-to-peer 
         lending in which the individual holding the IOU is extending credit to the issuer.
