            <h3>What is a DAC?</h3>
            <p>
              DAC stands for Decentralized Autonomous Company or previously Distributed Autonomous Corporation.  DACs are
              not legal entities and instead serve as a metaphor for describing how transparent, irreversable ledger systems such as Bitcoin
              operate.  DACs can have expenses (paying miners) and they can earn revenue (charging transaction fees).

            <h3>What is a crypto-equity?</h3>
            <p>
            A crypto-equity is a more accurate description of what a crypto-currency is.  Bitcoin is first and foremost a crypto-equity, but when it
            is used as a medium of exchange, it becomes a crypto-currency.  In the same ways shares in Apple (AAPL) are first and foremost
            an equity, but if they became <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearer_share.asp">bearer shares</a> and started circulating 
            in barter transactions they could become a currency as well.

            <h3>What is a BIP?</h3>
            <p>
            A BIP is one billionth of the current share supply and is the fundamental unit of account in a DAC.  Given 8,000,000 initial shares, a
            BIP would be .008 shares. The total number of shares in circulation is constantly decreasing as <a href="#dividend">dividends</a> are
            paid from transaction fees.
            </p>
            <p>
            While the number of shares in your wallet doesn't change, the number of BIPs in your wallet is constantly growing and in this 
            way users have a better unit of account.   The user interface of all DACs should completely hide the underlying shares and
            instead display all balances in termps of BIPs and all transfers should also be specified in terms of BIPs.

            <a name="dividends"><h3>What are Dividends?</h3></a>
            <p>
            In the context of a DAC a 'dividend' is a metaphor for the increase in the number of <a href="#bips">bips</a> contained in your
            wallet as the result of the share supply decreasing.   The share supply decreases anytime transaction fees are paid by those
            making transactions.

            <h3>What is a proto-DAC?</h3>
            <p>
            A proto-DAC is a company that doesn't implement the full feature set of the ultimate company, but which allows the trading
            of shares in one or more future companies while they are under development.  <a href="/bitshares/ags-pts.php">bitshares pts</a>
            is a proto-DAC for the entire industry.

            <a name="mining"><h3>How do I mine bitshares?</h3></a>
            <p>
            Bitshares are not a single crypto-equity and therefore asking "how do I mine bitshares?" is like asking "how do I earn money?". Do you
            want to earn US dollars or Euros?  Depending upon which DACs you would like to get a stake in there are four ways to mine:
            <ol>
              <li> Mine <a href="/bitshares/ags-pts.php">bitshares pts</a> for a stake in future DACs </li>
              <li> Mine with <a href="/bitshares/ags-pts.php">bitshares ags</a> by giving to bitshares.org</li>
              <li> A <a href="https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=3587.0;topicseen">Virtual Mining Pool</a> is under development.</li>
              <li> Mine the most profitable altcoin and trade for what you really want.</li>
            </ol>
            </p>

            <a name="bitshares-formatting"><h3>BitShares vs bitshares vs Bitshares vs bitShares which way is the right way?</h3></a>
            <p>
            This is a good question and it depends upon who you ask.  We currently recommend all lowercase all the time with the exception
            of the start of sentences.

            <a name="proof-of-stake"><h3>What is Proof of Stake?</h3></a>
            <p>
            Proof of stake is the concept that certain actions can only be performed by a shareholder proportional their stake (<a href="#bips">bips</a> owned).

            <a name="bitasset"><h3>What is a BitAsset?</h3></a>
            <p>
            BitAssets are an experimental digital asset class that are fungible and market-pegged to the value of anything from dollars, to gold, to gallons of gasoline. BitAssets can be transferred between users in the same way as bitcoins.

            <a name="short"><h3>What does shorting mean?</h3></a>
            <p>
	    Shorting an asset means borrowing it, selling it, then buying it back and returning it. This allows you to profit when you predict the value of an asset will fall. The BitShares X network issues BitAssets to people who take out short positions, using XTS (shares in bitshares X) as collateral.
