             DAC stands for Decentralized Autonomous Company or previously Distributed Autonomous Corporation.  DACs are
             not legal entities and instead serve as a metaphor for describing how transparent, irreversable ledger systems such as Bitcoin
             operate.  DACs can have expenses (paying miners) and they can earn revenue (charging transaction fees).

             A crypto-equity is a more accurate description of what a crypto-currency is.  Bitcoin is first and foremost a crypto-equity, but when it
             is used as a medium of exchange, it becomes a crypto-currency.  In the same ways shares in Apple (AAPL) are first and foremost
             an equity, but if they became <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearer_share.asp">bearer shares</a> and started circulating 
             in barter transactions they could become a currency as well.

             A BIP is one billionth of the current share supply and is the fundamental unit of account in a DAC.  Given 8,000,000 initial shares, a
             BIP would be .008 shares. The total number of shares in circulation is constantly decreasing as <a href="#dividend">dividends</a> are
             paid from transaction fees.
            <br><br>
             While the number of shares in your wallet doesn't change, the number of BIPs in your wallet is constantly growing and in this 
             way users have a better unit of account.   The user interface of all DACs should completely hide the underlying shares and
             instead display all balances in termps of BIPs and all transfers should also be specified in terms of BIPs.

             Bitshares are not a single crypto-equity and therefore asking "how do I mine bitshares?" is like asking "how do I earn money?". Do you
             want to earn US dollars or Euros?  Depending upon which DACs you would like to get a stake in there are four ways to mine:
             <ol>
               <li> Mine <a href="/bitshares/ags-pts.php">bitshares pts</a> for a stake in future DACs </li>
               <li> Mine with <a href="/bitshares/ags-pts.php">bitshares ags</a> by giving to bitshares.org</li>

                      Shorting an asset means borrowing it, selling it, then buying it back and returning it. This allows you to profit when you predict the value of an asset will fall. The BitShares X network issues BitAssets to people who take out short positions, using XTS (shares in bitshares X) as collateral.
