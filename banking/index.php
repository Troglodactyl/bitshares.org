      <h3><i>Decentalized</i> Bank & Exchange</h3>
      <p>
      Bitshares X is a family of DACs that implement the business model of a bank
      and exchange.   Banks create money by issuing bank notes based upon deposits
      or collateral.  Bank notes can be denominated in anything, including gold, silver,
      dollars, shares of a company, or gallons of gasoline.  
      </p>
      <p>
      These days most banks don't print physical bank notes, instead they maintain a
      balance on their books for each depositor.  The bank then facilitates the 
      transfer of balances among their customers and keeps the deposits safe.
      </p>
      <p>
      There are many different DACs that are implementing this business model, each of
      which specializes in a different type of deposits.  Each DAC comes with a built
      in full-featured exchange that allows customers to trade different types of
      deposits such as gold/dollars.
